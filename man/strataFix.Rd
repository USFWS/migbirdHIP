\description{
The internal \code{strataFix} function is used inside of \code{\link{clean}} to edit strata for states that submit permit files separately from HIP. If records from these states submit a "2" for the band_tailed_pigeon or crane field, they will be mistakenly identified as permit records. The \code{strataFix} function changes band_tailed_pigeon and/or crane "2" values to "0" so that they are classified as HIP records until permit files are received later in the hunting season.
