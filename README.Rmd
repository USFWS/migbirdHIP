## Overview

The migbirdHIP package provides a set of R functions for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Migratory Bird Program to process, clean, and visualize [Harvest Information Program](https://www.fws.gov/harvestsurvey) data.

Tasks that can be accomplished with this package include:

* `read_hip` imports data
* `clean` does basic reorganization tasks
* `fileCheck` makes sure all files are new
* `glyphCheck` identifies non-UTF-8 characters
* `shiftCheck` finds line shift errors
* `strataCheck` identifies any new or unexpected strata
* `issueCheck` looks for records that should be processed later
* `duplicateFinder` identifies duplicate HIP records
* `duplicateFix` resolves duplicate HIP records
* `proof` checks values for errors
* `correct` systematically fixes erroneous values
* Error visualization with `errorPlotDL`, `errorPlotFields`, and `errorPlotStates`
* Detailed error table reporting with `errorTable` and `pullErrors`
* Automated report writing with `writeReport` 
* Custom .csv writing with `write_hip`
